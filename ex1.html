  <h1>My Introduction</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is <strong>Mark Davidovich</strong>. I'm 34 years old, and I'm <em>very passionate</em> about computers and web development. <br />
    From a young age, I've always been curious about technology, often opening machines just to understand how they worked.
  </p>

  <h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>
    I have a few things I really enjoy doing. I love <strong>coding</strong> because it lets me combine creativity and logical thinking while producing visible, satisfying
    <br />
    results. I also enjoy cooking because it feels surprisingly similar to coding. You mix <em>creativity</em> with <em>technical skills</em> to create something good, and experimenting
    <br />
    with new dishes is half the fun. On top of that, I like to exercise and go out for walks, and when I have some free time, you'll usually find me playing a
    computer game.
  </p>

  <h2>My Goals</h2>
  <br>
    My main goal is to make a living by building <strong>full-stack</strong> applications—something I genuinely enjoy and care about. 
    I want to create meaningful 
    <br /> 
    experiences, whether that's for the wider world or even a small community. Being able to build applications from <em>start to finish</em> 
    <br />
    and see people enjoy using them is what motivates me the most. In the long term, my dream is to work in game development studios, <br /> or even open one of my own
    if everything aligns just right.
  </p>
  <h3>Short-term Goals</h3>
  <p>
    Over the next few months, I plan to give it my all by learning and mastering <strong>full-stack development</strong> and building solid, polished applications to add to my
    portfolio.
